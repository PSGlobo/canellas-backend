# PS Globo Backend

## About

This repository keeps the Rust backend for the challenge Globo proposed to their candidates.

## Dependencies

- Install Rust. You can find installation instructions [here](https://rustup.rs/).
- Install Docker and Docker Compose. They'll make it easier to setup the database locally.
- Clone the repository.

In the documentation, there are detailed instructions to test and run the application.

## Documentation

As any other Rust project, its documentation can be built locally by using the `cargo doc` command.

I suggest you to run `cargo doc --open --no-deps`, because it'll open the documentation on the browser after it finishes and the project dependencies won't be included, which will make the document generation faster.
